[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: operation replaceElementWithChildren(SanitizerElement)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "replaceElementWithChildren" missing
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: new Sanitizer({}) must inherit property "replaceElementWithChildren(SanitizerElement)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "replaceElementWithChildren" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: calling replaceElementWithChildren(SanitizerElement) on new Sanitizer({}) with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "replaceElementWithChildren" not found in prototype chain
