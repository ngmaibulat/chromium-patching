Steps to upgrade to a new version of GRPC, all relative to //third_party/grpc:
1. Update revision and version information in this file. Version file can be
   found in the root BUILD file in gRPC repo.
2. Run third_party/grpc/update.sh.
3. Update the BUILD.gn file with ./generate_gn.sh. To use the script,
  make sure the mako_templates python module is installed ("apt-get
  install python3-mako").

Note: Please also remember to check if `plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc`
needs update! Upstream sometimes introduces new plugins in
`/source/src/core/plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc` and we may need to update
our custom `grpc_plugin_registry.cc`.
